# lexical-analyzer
 It is a component of a compiler or interpreter that breaks down the source code into a sequence of tokens. Its main task is to read the input source code character by character and group them into meaningful units called tokens. The lexical analyzer performs the following tasks:

Tokenization: It scans the source code character by character and identifies the smallest meaningful units called tokens. Tokens can be keywords, identifiers, literals (such as numbers and strings), operators, punctuators, or other language-specific constructs.

Lexical analysis: It applies lexical rules defined by the programming language to determine the type of each token. For example, it identifies keywords, operators, and identifiers based on predefined rules.

Error handling: It detects and reports lexical errors, such as invalid characters or tokens that do not conform to the language's syntax rules.

Symbol table management: It may also maintain a symbol table, which is a data structure that stores information about identifiers encountered in the source code. This information can include the identifier's name, type, scope, and other attributes.

The output of the lexical analyzer is a stream of tokens, which is then passed to the next phase of the compiler or interpreter for further processing, such as parsing or semantic analysis. Overall, the lexical analyzer plays a crucial role in the compilation process by breaking down the source code into meaningful tokens, which are then used by subsequent phases to understand the structure and meaning of the program
